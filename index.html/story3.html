    <center> <h1> <b> COURAGE THE COWARDLY DOG</b></h1></center>
<p>
    Courage the Cowardly Dog follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), a kind yet easily frightened dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian.[3] Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea White), a friendly and caring Scottish woman who decided to take Courage in as her own, and was inspired by the nature of this first meeting to give him his name. In the present, Courage lives in an isolated farmhouse with the now elderly Muriel and her husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson in episodes 1–33, Arthur Anderson in episodes 34–52), a cranky and greedy man who is jealous of Courage, refers to him as "stupid dog", and periodically uses the "Ooga Booga" mask to scare him out of his wits. The nearest town to the farmhouse is called Nowhere.

    Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, zombies, and other paranormal or supernatural creatures that are attracted to Nowhere. The plot generally uses conventions common to horror films. Although most of the creatures the three face are hostile, some only appear that way, but are simply suffering from distress, anger, and/or acting in desperation, and sometimes because they are depressed, but they can turn out to be friendly to them.

    The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses much of his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks.

    Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show's cast, including Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer (Simon Prebble); the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (Paul Schoeffler); a fortune-telling chihuahua named Shirley the Medium (Mary Testa); Eustace's mother "Ma" (Billie Lou Watt); villains Katz and Le Quack (both voiced by Schoeffler), and the antagonistic Di Lung (Tim Chi Ly)
